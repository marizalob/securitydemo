<h1>Index</h1>
<p>Congratulations you can access this.</p>
@if (User.IsInRole("CanBeAwesome"))
{
  <p>Apparently you are awesome so you can also access @Html.ActionLink("this", "outofyourleague")</p>
}
else
{
  <p>But you cannot access - @Html.ActionLink("this", "awesomepage")</p>
  <p>
  If you try the default behaviour is to redirect you to the forms authentication logon url... which is bit stupid. 
  If you are already logged on it should just return a 403.
